<h3>Welcome to <span class="abjectfailure" >ONKart</span></h3>

<img src="images/printer.JPG" class="littleimage" /><span class="abjectfailure" >ONKart</span> was established to make high quality fine art giclees&#8211;both original giclee prints and fine art reproductions&#8211;available to working artists. We are located in the El Sobrante Valley, an unincorporated area of Contra Costa County, California, which also includes parts of Richmond and Pinole. We are located on the east side of the San Francisco Bay Area.

<h3>Original Giclee Prints</h3>

<p>As well as coming to <span class="abjectfailure" >ONKart</span> for museum quality reproductions considering working with us as part of your artmaking process.  We work with artists to modify, crop, enlarge, re-scan and otherwise develop a final work of art, combining hand work and digital process.  Consider Giclee a form of printmaking, like lithography, or etching.  Or include it in your photography process for producing large negative films from which contact prints can be made.  We can work with you on an hourly or negotiated basis.<a href="giclees-type.php" >  Go here for more information</a></p>

<p>Our print prices vary between <strong><em>$6/sq. ft and $15/ sq. ft.</em></strong> for printing on our standard supports (e.g. paper and canvas) plus any special labor required. If we provide reproductions for you, we will also provide minimum color correction.  Extensive color correction will be charged at our graphic art services rate (see below).  We are happy to print from images that you bring to us, in which case, we will print from those images as is unless you desire special color correction at our standard rate.  The price for printing on specialty materials will vary with support cost and labor required.</p>

<!-- <p>Some details:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Art Paper:  </strong>All of our art paper is archival with at least a 75+ year rating; some of our papers are rated at 100+ years.

<h3>Scan or Photograph Your Artwork</h3>

<h4 style="display:inline;" >Scanning Artwork:</H4> 
Our <em>preferred method<strong></strong></em> for digitizing art is with our graphic arts flatbed scanner. Artwork of any size can be scanned at optical resolutions as high as 2400 dpi, making prints spring to life with the finest detail and making it possible to enlarge artwork many times. Color accuracy is assured through the use of scanner profiles created with state of the art spectrographic equipment and software.

<ul> 
<li>Scan images smaller than 12in x17in:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong><em>$15</em></strong></li>
<li>Multiple scans (where required): <strong><em>$6 for each additional 10in x14in section of original artwork</em></strong></li>
</ul>

<h4 style="display:inline;" >Digital Camera Images:</h4> Images produced with Canon Photographic equipment and studio lighting calibrated with ColorChecker software and expodisk light profiling produces high quality digital images with excellent color accuracy.

<ul>
<li>Digital image from Camera:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong><em>$35</em></strong></li>
<li>$50/hr for any extensive color correction of scanned or photographed images.</li>
</ul>


<h3 class="inline">Graphic art services</h3>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong><em>$50/hour or negotiated on a project basis</em></strong>

<ul>
<li>Color correction of scanned, photographed or provided images in Photoshop</li>
<li>Special image cropping or preparation</li>
<li>Other graphic arts services</li>
</ul>


<!--<p><strong><em>**Advantages of scanned images:</em></strong></p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Price:</strong> For a similar high resolution digital file of your artwork at other Giclee shops, you will pay $70 or more, once you have paid a high resolution premium and the cost of generating and applying a color profile.  High resolution and accuracy of color reproduction are built into our scanning process so there are no additional charges for these features.</li>

<li><strong>High resolution:</strong> Scanning can optically produce images with a resolution of up to 2400 dots per inch.  This high resolution allows for significant enlargements of originals when desired and extremely accurate reproductions of images when printed at the original size.  We have had great success enlarging 8 inch originals to 4 foot (or even larger) prints.</li>

<li><strong>High image accuracy:</strong>  The 16 bit image data we are able to get with our scanner, Macintosh/Photoshop hardware and software as well as special printer drivers, allows for accurate printing at 2880 dpi, producing, essentially, continuous-tone prints.</li>  

<li><strong>High color accuracy:</strong>  Our scanner produces highly colormetric image files through the use of scanner color profiles.  These profiles are appled by the scanner software so that very little manual color correction is required.  In contrast, images derived from digital cameras and cameras with scan backs normally require the added effort of creating and applying color profiles manually.  We update our profiles regularly to assure their accuracy.</li>  

<li><strong>Capturing detail:</strong> Optically focused high resolution scanned images make the observer feel like they can reach out and feel the texture in the image.</li> 
</ul>
