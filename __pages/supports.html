<h3>ONKart Prices</h3>

<em>Prices will be Discounted for Local artists</em>
<p>Our standard Giclee prices vary between $6/sq. ft and $12/ sq. ft. depending on the support on which they are printed and any special labor required.  The price for printing on specialty supports will vary with support cost and labor required. Some details:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Paper:  </strong>All of our paper is archival with at least a 75+ year rating; some of our papers are rated at 100+ years.  We have economically priced pulp based paper as well as 10% rag, lignin and acid free papers.  (Prices range between $6-12/ sq. ft.)</li>

<li><strong>Canvas:</strong>  We provide an industry standard cotton/polyester mix canvas that looks very much like a gesso coated canvas.  Pure cotton and other canvases are also available. (Prices range between $9-12/sg. ft.)</li>

<li><strong>Vinyl:</strong>  For outdoor applications, we provide a scrim vinyl support.  We can hem the edges of images printed on vinyl to prevent curling and install grommets if desired.   (Prices range between $8-10/sq. ft. plus hemming and grommetting costs)</li>

<li><strong>Fabric:</strong>  We can print on a variety of fabrics, including silk.  For large sizes, we are able to prepare cloth to your specifications.  (Prices vary with material and labor involved.)</li>

<li><strong>Specialty printing supports:</strong>  Clear, metallic or color film, transluscent vinyl, front or back lit polypropylene, self-adhesive surfaces, rigid pvc film, light blocking film and more are available. (Prices vary)</li>
</ul>

<h3>Additional color correction and other graphic art services</h3>
$50/hour

<li>Photos of artwork provided to you on disk</li>

<h3>Creating image files of your artwork for reproduction</h3>

<h4>Scanned images</h4>

<ul> 
<li>Scan images smaller than 12in x17in:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;$12</li>
<li>Multiple scans (where required): $6 for each 10in x14in section of original artwork</li>
</ul>

Our preferred method for digitizing art is with our graphic arts flatbed scanner.  This provides a number of advantages:

<ul>
<li><strong>Price:</strong> For a similar high resolution digital file of your artwork at other Giclee shops, you will pay $70 or more, once you have paid a high resolution premium and the cost of generating and applying a color profile.  High resolution and accuracy of color reproduction are built into our scanning process so there are no additional charges for these features.</li>

<li><strong>High resolution:</strong> Scanning can optically produce images with a resolution of up to 2400 dots per inch.  This high resolution allows for significant enlargements of originals when desired and extremely accurate reproductions of images when printed at the original size.  We have had great success enlarging 8 inch originals to 4 foot (or even larger) prints.</li>

<li><strong>High image accuracy:</strong>  The 16 bit image data we are able to get with our scanner, Macintosh/Photoshop hardware and software as well as special printer drivers, allows for accurate printing at 2880 dpi, producing, essentially, continuous-tone prints.</li>  

<li><strong>High color accuracy:</strong>  Our scanner produces highly colormetric image files through the use of scanner color profiles.  These profiles are appled by the scanner software so that very little manual color correction is required.  In contrast, images derived from digital cameras and cameras with scan backs normally require the added effort of creating and applying color profiles manually.  We update our profiles regularly to assure their accuracy.</li>  

<li><strong>Capturing detail:</strong> Through manual/auto-focusing optics our scanner captures subtle detail.  When printed, scanned images make the observer feel like they can reach out and feel</li> 
</ul>

<h4>Digital Camera Images</h4>

<ul>
<li>Digital image from Camera (using ColorChecker):&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;$25</li>
<li>$50/hr for any extensive color correction of scanned or photographed images (see below)</li>
</ul>
